I am an engineer at MIT Lincoln Labs working on robotics and ML projects in the defense R&D space. Previously, I completed my undergrad in Math&CS from UIUC, where I worked on autonomous vehicle research advised by [Shenlong Wang](https://shenlong.web.illinois.edu/). My primary interests are computer vision and robotics/autonomy.
