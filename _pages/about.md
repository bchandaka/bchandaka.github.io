I'm currently working on research in robotics and computer vision advised by Prof. [Shenlong Wang](https://shenlong.web.illinois.edu/). I am currently working on building a [custom mobile manipulation platform](/projects/mm_robot/) for last-mile delivery. Previously, I completed my undergrad in Math&CS from UIUC, where I worked on autonomous vehicle research. 

**Interest/Skills Statement**
- I most enjoy getting hands-on and integrating algorithms onto physical robot/autonomy systems to work in the real-world. 
- I have more experience on the *perception side* including working with edge devices/sensors, training custom cv/ml models, point clouds, and Vision-Language models. On the *planning/control side*, I’ve integrated Nav2/Moveit2 onto new robots and worked with basic waypoint following controllers/PID. 
- I also have good SWE skills(testing in simulation, Docker containers, CICD, OOP, documentation, etc.) and a generalist “maker” skillset including 3D printing, Fusion 360 CAD, robot building, and hobby electronics.
