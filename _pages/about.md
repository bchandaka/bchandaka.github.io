I am an MSCS student at UIUC working on research in robotics and computer vision advised by Prof. [Shenlong Wang](https://shenlong.web.illinois.edu/). Previously, I completed my undergrad in Math&CS from UIUC, where I worked on autonomous vehicle research also advised by Prof. [Shenlong Wang](https://shenlong.web.illinois.edu/).
