I'm currently leading the development of a custom mobile manipulation research platform for last-mile delivery(CAD Design, Hardware system setup, physical building, gazebo simulation, Sensor/ROS2 Nav2/Moveit2 Integration, Vision-Language Models). Our goal is to have a robot that can navigate around new buildings and outdoors as well to deliver items from one room number to another.
