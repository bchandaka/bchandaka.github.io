I co-founded a ACM special interest group, [SigRobotics](https://sigrobotics.acm.illinois.edu/), with a team of 4 students to explore the cs/ece side of robotics. We have raised over $5k in funding to buy hardware and build open source mobile robots and robot arms to learn basic navigation/control/Machine Learning/etc. I help lead discussions on relevant topics and project work sessions with 10+ members each week as well. Two of our projects even have support/collaborations with companies like [Kscale Labs](https://kscale.dev/) and [Huggingface's LeRobot Project](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot).
