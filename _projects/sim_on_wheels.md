Co-authored a novel research work, Sim-on-Wheels, that implements a new way to evaluate autonomous vehicles in safety-critical scenarios using an augmented reality approach. Led the integration of multiple software modules to run our system in realtime at ~10fps on a real-world autonomy platform. Presented at the 2025 IEEE International Conference for Robotics and Automation(ICRA) in Yokohama, Japan in both oral and poster formats to large audiences.
