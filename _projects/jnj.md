I designed a new, production-level software feature to improve the safety of the Monarch surgical robot after a sudden system restart while interning at Johnson&Johnson MedTech. I added new capabilities to the simulation environment to allow this feature to be tested in sim. The feature was evaluated in both sim and real hardware for 5+ test case scenarios. I presented my work to director-level colleagues in a poster session and met all project goals on time.
