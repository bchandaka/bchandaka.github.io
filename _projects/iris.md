During my undergrad, I was the autonomous team lead for [Illinois Robotics in Space](https://iris.ae.illinois.edu/) , a club that creates a lunar rover robot for the NASA robot mining competition. I got lots of hands-on experience working with building software for a robot system including: ros2, custom gazebo simulation, slam, remote control teleoperation, maintaining a strong internal wiki, and more.
